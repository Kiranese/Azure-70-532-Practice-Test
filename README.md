FYI, this is not an exhaustive set of test questions, just some I put together to help me study for and pass the exam. These questions are based on documentations material and the exam objectives list; and are not based on the actual exam or gear towards "teaching the exam" in any way.

This was the most major update to the exam that Microsoft has done to date.
